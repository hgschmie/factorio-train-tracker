# Train Tracker

Track what all the trains are doing.

## Features

Train Tracker records:

- time and distance traveled
- time spent waiting at stops and signals
- last, current and next station
- current and total freight moved by a train

![Distance/Time](https://github.com/hgschmie/factorio-train-tracker/raw/main/portal/gui-1.png)
![Stations](https://github.com/hgschmie/factorio-train-tracker/raw/main/portal/gui-2.png)
![Freight](https://github.com/hgschmie/factorio-train-tracker/raw/main/portal/gui-3.png)

Limit, Filter and sorting settings persist across the tabs (it is possible to sort by distance and then switch to another tab to look e.g. at the freight). Freight is sorted by the number of different items/fluids transported.

## Hotkey

The GUI hotkey by default is 'Control + Shift + T' (Option + Shift + T for macOS).
