Version: 1.0.1
Date: 2025-09-21
  Changes:
    - move debug setting to startup
    - change distance computing to use the actual train path and don't try to recompute. The
      train does not actually leave from the station but from a rail that is a little bit before
      the station. As a result, the train manager sometimes could not compute a path that a train
      was travelling just fine.
